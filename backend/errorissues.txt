Here are the potential issues that could affect the functionality of the backend application:

Missing Implementation in google_calender.py: The file is either empty or not implemented, which is critical for Google Calendar integration.

Database Connection Issues: The db object in appointment_routes.py must be properly established and configured to avoid runtime errors when inserting or retrieving appointments.

Lack of Error Handling: The routes do not have error handling, which could lead to crashes or unhelpful error messages. Implementing try-except blocks would improve robustness.

Environment Variables: The contents of the .env file are not visible. Ensure that it contains the correct configuration settings and API keys.

Dependency Management: Verify that all dependencies listed in requirements.txt are installed and compatible with the current Python version to avoid import errors or runtime issues.
